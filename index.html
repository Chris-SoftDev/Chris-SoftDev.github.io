                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Christopher Ronca, and I am proud to present my ePortfolio as I complete my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). I began this academic journey in August 2020 while serving in the United States Air Force, and after retiring from a 20-year military career, I have dedicated myself fully to advancing my education and preparing for a new chapter in the technology field.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout my time in the Computer Science program, I have gained a strong foundation in both the theory and practice of software development. Three of the most important skills I have developed are:
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Software Development:</strong> I have learned to design, build, and integrate both front-end and back-end applications. This includes working with multiple programming languages, connecting user interfaces to databases, and ensuring that applications are modular, maintainable, and scalable.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Algorithmic Problem Solving:</strong> I have honed my ability to analyze problems, design efficient algorithms, and implement appropriate data structures. This has enabled me to write code that is not only correct but also optimized for performance and resource usage—an essential skill for real-world software engineering.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Database Design and Management:</strong> I have gained hands-on experience with both relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases, learning how to model data, write complex queries, and ensure data integrity and security. Understanding the strengths and trade-offs of different database systems has been crucial for building robust, data-driven applications.
                    <br><br>
                    The enhancements showcased in this portfolio are designed to demonstrate my proficiency in several key areas aligned with the program’s outcomes. Through my work, I aim to highlight:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Full-Stack Application Architecture:</strong> By converting my project to a PERN stack single-page application, I demonstrate the ability to design and implement a modern, modular web application, clearly separating concerns between the frontend (React), backend (Express/Node.js), and database (PostgreSQL).</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Adaptability:</strong> Migrating from a Python/MongoDB backend to JavaScript/Node.js and PostgreSQL illustrates my capacity to learn and apply new languages, frameworks, and paradigms.</li>
                        <li><strong>RESTful API Design:</strong> I have designed and implemented RESTful endpoints to handle CRUD operations, authentication, and error management—essential skills for scalable software engineering.</li>
                        <li><strong>UI/UX Principles:</strong> Using React, I have built a responsive, interactive user interface, applying best practices in component-based design and state management.</li>
                    </ul>
                    These skills directly support my career goals in software engineering, particularly my aspiration to specialize in full-stack web development. By building a modern web application from the ground up, I have prepared myself to work confidently on both the front-end and back-end, which is essential for today’s development roles. My experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases, along with optimizing data models and queries, means I am ready to tackle the data challenges central to most technology jobs.
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, these experiences have helped me become a well-rounded developer who can adapt to new technologies and contribute meaningfully to any team. This project, in particular, has given me hands-on experience with the tools and workflows used in the industry, deepened my understanding of scalable and efficient application design, and strengthened my confidence to take on complex projects in my chosen field. I am excited to bring these skills into my career and to solve real-world problems with creativity and confidence.

                <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
                <p>
                    Completing my coursework in the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio have been
                    transformative experiences that have both showcased my strengths and shaped my professional goals.
                    Throughout the program, I have gained not only technical proficiency but also a deeper understanding
                    of the collaborative, communicative, and ethical dimensions of the field. These experiences have
                    prepared me to contribute effectively in professional environments and have reinforced my commitment
                    to technical excellence, user-centered design, and lifelong learning.</br></br>

                    One of the most valuable aspects of my education has been the opportunity to collaborate in team environments. In several courses, I worked on group projects where we designed, implemented, and tested software solutions together. These experiences taught me how to communicate technical ideas clearly, resolve conflicts constructively, and leverage the diverse strengths of my teammates.

In my capstone project, I regularly updated my professor and peers on my progress, solicited feedback, and adapted my approach based on their input. This iterative communication process not only improved the quality of my work but also reinforced the importance of aligning technical solutions with user needs and organizational goals.</br></br>
                    
                    My coursework has provided a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, which I have applied to solve real-world problems efficiently. I have implemented and optimized algorithms for searching, sorting, and filtering data, both in academic assignments and in my capstone project. These skills have enabled me to design systems that are not only functional but also performant and scalable.</br></br>
                    
                    In the areas of software engineering and databases, I have developed full-stack applications using modern frameworks and best practices. I am proficient in designing normalized relational schemas, writing secure and maintainable code, and integrating frontend and backend components. My experience with version control, automated testing, and continuous integration has prepared me to contribute effectively to professional software development teams.</br></br>
                    
                    Security has been a consistent priority throughout my studies. I have implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms, protected sensitive data, and followed secure coding standards. I understand the importance of safeguarding user information and maintaining the integrity of software systems in an increasingly connected world.</br></br>
                    
                    The artifacts included in my ePortfolio represent the culmination of these skills and experiences. Together, they demonstrate my ability to design, build, and secure complex software systems from the ground up. My portfolio includes a full-stack web application for managing animal shelter outcomes, which integrates advanced search and filtering, dynamic data visualization, and robust authentication. Each artifact highlights a different aspect of my expertise, whether it is database design, algorithmic problem-solving, or user interface development, collectively they provide a comprehensive view of my capabilities as a computer scientist.</br></br>
                    
                    By assembling this portfolio, I have not only documented my technical achievements but also clarified my professional values: collaboration, clear communication, technical excellence, and a commitment to security and user-centered design. I am confident that the skills and mindset I have developed throughout this program have prepared me to make meaningful contributions in the computer science field, and I look forward to applying them as I advance in my career.
